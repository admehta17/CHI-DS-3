#### Final Project

For the Data Science final project, you will address a data- related problem in your professional field or in a field you interested in. You will acquire a real-world data set, form a hypothesis about it, clean, parse, and apply modeling techniques and data analysis principles to ultimately create a predictive model. Students present their results and each write a report that includes the following:

Clearly articulated problem statement
Summary of data acquisition, cleaning, and parsing stage
Clear presentation of your predictive model and the processes you took to create it
Presentation style appropriate to the audience

Your instructor will help you scope out your project so that you choose something that is feasible to accomplish given the skills you acquire in the course.

### Unit Projects

Globally, we have 4 Unit Projects in Data Science, each building on top of skills learned previously to scaffold students' learning over the entire course. Our projects include objectives, requirements, starter-code, rubric, and suggested resources - all of which tie into the overall competencies for each unit.
